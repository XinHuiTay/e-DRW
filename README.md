# Entropy-based Directed Random Walk (e-DRW)
 e-DRW is an entropy-based pathway activity inference method based on directed random walk on two separated directed pathway networks (KEGG and PID networks) for cancer classification and prediction. It employs a larger coverage of human pathway information and robust gene-weighting method to infer pathway activites for disease classification.
